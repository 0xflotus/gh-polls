## About

These polls work by pasting individual markdown SVG images into your issue, each wrapped with a link that tracks a vote. A single vote per IP is allowed for a given poll, which are stored in DynamoDB.

What do they look like? The poll above is live, click one out and give it a try! Please don't abuse it or I'll have to take it down :).
